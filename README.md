# Clashrun

![clashrun](Assets\Clashrun.gif)

Clashrun is a CLI intuitive tool for playing Clash of Code locally, designed for Linux environments. It supports only scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, and JavaScript.

## Installation

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/Scriptmagum/ClashRun.git'
cd ClashRun
```
## Usage  

For the first time, you'll need to download all dependencies. Try:
```bash
chmod 744 install.sh
./install.sh
python3 Clashrun.py
```

NB: I’ll assume all Linux distros have vi installed by default, but for more immersive experience, you can use codium, nano,gedit pluma, or your favorite editor but assume it is installed in your distro before.

set editor:`<editor name>`

For more commands, just type: `help`
